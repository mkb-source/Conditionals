Conditionals in Data Mining
This project is a quick look into shelter data from the Humane Society of East Tennessee.
This data contained animal species, ID #, their inevitable outcome (adopted, returned to owner, euthanasia, etc.). In this project,
I separated each animal by their species, outcome, and whether correlation  between an animal's species
was related to their outcome type. This project displays the skills: creating subsets, creating aesthetically pleasing & meaningful visuals, separating dates using different formats,
and changing class types of columns for data manipulation purposes. This project includes a word document reporting my findings within this dataset.
